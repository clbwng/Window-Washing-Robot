# Window-Washing-Robot
Custom built robot from Lego EV3 parts designed to be suspended from the top of a window.  The borders of the window can be set with the robot and then once started, the robot will automatically clean the window every couple minutes.  The robot will also stop moving if it gets blown off course or detects obstacles in the way.
